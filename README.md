Student Javascript project for Software Engineering 1A and 1B at Ara Institute of Canterbury

This project was originally begun in S2 2017 in Software Engineering 101, as a basic look into classes and CRUD.
It was picked up again in Software Engineering 102 in S1 2018, with the assignment being to iterate upon and improve the original program.
Some options on what to do were suggested. We chose to refactor our old code slightly, create a static version of a better display for the final data output, create our own .csv import method using javascript and the HTML5 FileReader API, and then create a dynamically generated webpage to render the data output to.
